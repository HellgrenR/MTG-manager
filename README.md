Create a program to store my MTG cards and decks in a database.

I will use: 
mysql-connector-python,
mtgsdk https://github.com/MagicTheGathering/mtg-sdk-python


I've created a program where I can upload my magic the gathering decks.
I added methods to view statistics like the mana curve, color composition and such.
