Create a program to store my MTG cards and decks in a database.

I will use: 
mysql-connector-python,
mtgsdk https://github.com/MagicTheGathering/mtg-sdk-python


This has also turned into a school project.
I will create diagrams of decks using pandas and matplot.
Hopefully I will have enough time to try to use NLP or Numpy aswell.
